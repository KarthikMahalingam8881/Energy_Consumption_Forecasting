# Energy Consumption Forecasting

This repository contains a comprehensive data science project aimed at forecasting energy consumption using machine learning techniques. The project leverages historical data and predictive modeling to generate reliable energy usage predictions, aiding in resource planning and optimization.

## Project Structure

- **Energy_consumption_forecasting.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, data processing, visualization, and model implementation.

## Features and Workflow

### 1. **Data Exploration**
   - Loaded and explored the dataset to understand the trends and patterns in energy consumption.
   - Visualized key features such as time-series trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.
   - Normalized and scaled features for better model performance.
   - Created additional features such as time-based features or aggregated metrics.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracted meaningful features from the dataset to improve the model's predictive power.

### 4. **Model Implementation**
   - Built predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or any other models explored.
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation to improve model accuracy and robustness.

### 5. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluated model performance using key metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
   - Compared the effectiveness of different models and approaches.

### 6. **Visualization**
   - Generated insightful visualizations to interpret model predictions and actual energy consumption trends.
   - Used time-series plots, error distributions, and feature importance charts.

### 7. **Forecasting**
   - Used the trained model to forecast future energy consumption based on the historical data.
